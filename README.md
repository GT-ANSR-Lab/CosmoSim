# CosmoSim

CosmoSim is the an open-source simulator to model satellite network capacity released as part of the
_Assessing LEO Satellite Networks for National Emergency Failover_ paper at IMC 2025.  The code
bundled here is curated for public release: configuration generators, graph
builders, traffic-engineering runners, spectrum-management tooling, and plotting
scripts are organised around a shared data directory so you can reproduce the
pipeline end-to-end without hauling large intermediate artefacts.


The paper can be found [here](http://saeed.github.io/files/cosmosim-imc25.pdf).

The web app visualizing the output of this simulator can be found [here](https://saeed.github.io/cosmosim-webapp/).
