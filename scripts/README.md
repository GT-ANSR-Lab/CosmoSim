# Scripts

Batch runners and orchestration helpers for CosmoSim workflows.

- `run_generate_flows.py`, `run_generate_capacities.py`, and the competing-traffic variant coordinate multi-scenario sweeps.
- Scripts emit command logs under `data/command_logs/` for traceability.

Invoke these when you want to build large scenario suites without hand-crafting each workflow command.
