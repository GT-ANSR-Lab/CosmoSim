# Kontur Population Dataset

The Kontur population rasters are not bundled with this repository. Download the required `.gpkg` files directly from Kontur:

- https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population
- https://www.kontur.io/data

Place the downloaded files in this directory following any structure your workflow expects. Keep the files out of version control (they typically exceed common Git hosting limits).
